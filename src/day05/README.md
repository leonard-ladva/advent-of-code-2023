## Notes
**Part 1**: 01:09:12 --> **Part 2**: --:--:--
* 1st part: Even tough my solution is quite easy to read/understand, I feel like theres a better and more interesting solve, like some tree where each range is a node or smth.
* Second not solved yet.
* At first in the second part a implemented a solution which would add all the seed nubmers to an array and then I wouldn't have to change anything else from the 1st part. Of course the moment that I looked at the data and saw that the second range length is over 1 billion numbers, I understood that I might have a problem, and that I might have to look for a more sophisticated solution.
