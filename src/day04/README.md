## Notes
**Part 1**: 00:10:55 --> **Part 2**: 00:10:09
* Quite satisfied with the first part, thought of the correct regex right of the bat (not that it is a difficult regex, but still) and understood that the win points are just 2^(wins-1) except for 0.
* Second part was quite good also, figured out the logic on paper first, which took about 3mins then started solving and didn't have any major issues.
